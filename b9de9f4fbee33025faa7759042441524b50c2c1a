      "message": "If I recall correctly, checkouts with `--mirror` don\u0027t care about the default branch name, I just had to add basically anything to keep something else in `repo` from breaking. Although, I guess, no harm in updating it either.\n\nUpdating the \"add by default\" branch for aosp-minimal is obviously a good thing, in case Google ever stops updating the legacy branch name.\n\nCAF can probably be left as-is, it was only really intended for the people who wanted to mirror all the things before the site shut down.",
