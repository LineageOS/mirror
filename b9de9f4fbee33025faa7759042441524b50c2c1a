Although, I guess, no harm in updating it either.\n\nUpdating the \"add by default\" branch for aosp-minimal is obviously a good thing, in case Google ever stops updating the legacy branch name.\n\nCAF can probably be left as-is, it was only really intended for the people who wanted to mirror all the things before the site shut down.",
